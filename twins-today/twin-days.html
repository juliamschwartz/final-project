  <h1>Twin Days Festival</h1>
  <p>While it goes unbeknownst to most people, there is an annual twins festival that takes place each year. Appropriately, Twins Days is hosted in Twinsburg, Ohio and has been since 1976. To this day, it is the largest annual gathering of biological twins in the world and each year it brings thousands of participants. Each year on the first week of August, twins from all over gather to meet other sets as well as take part in the festivities. According to the Twins Days Festival Committee, people from Nigeria, Australia, Canada, and France pre-registered for the festival in 2014. </p>
  <p align="left">During this week-long festival, there are numerous activities that twins and their families can participate in. The event schedule for the last Twins Days ranged from a Welcome Wiener Roast, Dj and Karaoke,Twins “Double-Take&quot; Parade, and a Contest.  Personally, I have always wanted to attend Twins Days, but due to work I always seem to have a conflict. However, I do look at the pictures posted from the event and have been jealous of everyone with the opportunity to go. For people who hear the never-ending “seeing-double” jokes and are faced with others who simply do not try to learn the difference, going to a place where none of these usual obstacles exist is a tempting thought.</p>
