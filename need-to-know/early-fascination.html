  <p>Twins have been the topic of conversation for many years and even dates back to Hippocrates and Plato. Towards the beginning of time, these philosophers believed that there were connections to other worldly beings, such as astronomy. However, eventually scientists used twins to study genetics and DNA. Sir Francis Galton was the first scientist to use twins to create a hypothesis about human development. Many people focused on the statistics and probability  of a women conceiving twins, and this is still slightly unknown.</p>
  <p>Today, scientists have learned the process of conceiving twins and the many different types that exist. Mirror twins are identical twins with exact reflections of each other. Conjoined twins, or siamese twins, are joined together during pregnancy. This is a rare and unfortunate phenomenon; about half of conjoined twins are still born and many who do survive have a abnormalities that make living a normal life impossible. </p>
  <p>Many studies still go on today to determine the complex bond and unique connection between a set of twins. Some believe that we can hear our sibling's thoughts or feel their pain and discomfort. Others focus on the genetic and environmental factors that play a role in a woman giving birth to twins. Identical twins are still a relatively unknown phenomenon that scientists have a lot to learn about. </p>
