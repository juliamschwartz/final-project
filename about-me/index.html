  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Julia and I am an identical twin. Now, while that not sound as exciting as being a lion tamer or rhythmic gymnast, I think it is pretty neat. Many people don’t know the difference between siblings and twins, let alone what fraternal and identical means. But, to be honest, it doesn’t matter whether or not people know what any of those words or classifications mean. If you are not a twin, you’re just not going to get it. </p>
  <p>Its like an inside joke that you have to been born into to understand. Being a twin, in my case identical, means that your life is going to be filled with moments and experiences that other siblings won’t have. For example, never being referred to by your actual name. It will most likely be your twin’s name, or a variation or your own, or even just a “I’m not sure who you are, but I think you are the right one”. Yeah, this actually happens. Or people blatantly staring at you on the subway because they can’t understand how similar you really are. Don’t worry, being looked at like you are an animal in a zoo is just part of the job. </p>
  <p>But, for the most part, being an identical twin really doesn’t have any draw backs. You get a built-in best friend and buddy for life; what’s better than that? Most people that come up to you will look at you in jealousy, wishing they had exactly this. I hear this quite often because I go to college with my twin sister; in fact, we live in the same room together. There are of course people who think we are crazy and too attached, but then again, they don’t get the joke. The thought of leaving my sister, my best friend, wasn’t really an option. </p>
  <p>I may have talked a lot about the so-called “negative parts” of being a twin, but at the end of the day, having a twin has only been a blessing for me. And truthfully, I don’t think I would have made it this far without her by my side.</p>
