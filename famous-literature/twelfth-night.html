+    <td><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Page Content" -->Twelfth Night is a comedy written by William Shakespeare around 1601 to be played during the Christmas season. The play centers on two twins Viola and Sebastian who are separated in a shipwreck. In the beginning of the play, Viola says that her twin brother has drowned at see, but the captain tells her that he might be alive. It turns out that Sebastian has been rescued by a sea captain named Antonio and they sail to a country named Illyria which is ruled by Duke Orsino. Meanwhile, Viola has disguised herself as a man and is working for the Duke. She ends up falling in love with Duke Orsino but the Duke then falls in love with Countess Olivia instead. The Countess falls mistakenly in love with Viola, who is disguised as a man. When Sebastian returns from sea, Olivia asks him to marry her, not knowing who he is. He ends up saying yes and the Duke agrees to marry Viola after the twins have reunited at the end of the play.<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></td>
