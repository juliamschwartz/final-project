  <p>Full House was an American sitcom created by Jeff Franklin that took place in San Fransico. It aired from September 22, 1987 to May 23, 1995 with 8 seasons and 192 episodes. The show begins when Danny Tanner learns that his wife was killed in a car accident when she was hit by a drunk driver. His brother-in-law Jesse and his quirky best friend Joey move in to help him raise his three girls. Danny's three girls, DJ, Stephanie, and Michelle all fall in love with Jesse and Joey and the show illustrates their lives as they grow up. In season two, Danny begins to co-host<em> Wake Up, San Fransico </em>with Rebecca Donaldson. Eventually, Rebecca and Jesse fall in love and have a pair of twin boys. </p>
  <p>Famously, Michelle is played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Due to labor laws, Michelle's character had to be played by both girls who  were only 6 when the series began. From then on, this famous duo was referred to as the Olsen Twins, and stared in other movies and television shows.  The Olsens joined the ranks of the wealthiest women in the entertainment industry at a young age. Today, they are co-presidents of their company &quot;Dualstar&quot; and have sold home decorations and fragerences. The brand has been sold in 3,000 stores in the United States and over 5,000 worldwide. Today, Mary-Kate and Ashely have become fashion icons, and have clothing lines and beauty products. In 2013, the twins launched a fashion line called &quot;Oslo&quot; in Norway.</p>
  <p>These Hollywood stars grew up in people's homes as Michelle Tanner from Full House, and have never been able to separate from each other. Although the girls have stared in other films, they are most known for being &quot;The Olsen Twins&quot;. Mary-Kate and Ashley are one of the most famous sets of identical twins. What makes them stand out, is that they grew up in the film industry together as a set, not as indiviuals. The thing that makes them unique isn't their talent or abiltiy alone, but that they are twins. </p>
