  <p>The Parent Trap is a 1998 romantic comedy that stars a couple who was immediately divorced after marrying and moves to different countries. The long separated couple is reunited 11 years later when their twin daughters, who were separated at birth, are reunited. Hallie Parker and Annie James meet at an all girls summer camp in Maine and finally meet. Hallie has been raised by her father in Napa Valley while Annie has grown up across the pond in England with her mother. While the girls have grown up on opposite sides of the world, they certainly have their similarities. </p>
  <p>The identical pair is played by Lindsay Lohan and the movie is still a favorite in the minds of many teenage girls. This film sticks out in my mind when it comes to twins on television because although Lohan is not a twin, she portrays a very realistic situation. There are many scenes in this movie when the twins are unrecognizable and even their parents struggle to tell them apart. There is also a famous scene when the girls mimic each other. Many of these moments actually occur on a daily basis for twins not on the big screen and I think this movie depicts them in a very accurate and humorous way.</p>
